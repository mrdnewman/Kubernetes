Nginx ingress controller in EKS not able to route traffic to pods
res: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58398526/nginx-ingress-controller-in-eks-not-able-to-route-traffic-to-pods

Issue:
amazon-k8s-cni:v1.5.4

Solution:
going back to v1.5.3 seemed to resolve issue. I think they recently 
reverted the plugin back to v1.5.3 for when an eks cluster is launched anyways.
